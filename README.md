# 1DDCNNï¼šOTDR&DTS Denoise

Welcome to the OTDR&DTS denoise repository, which presents a 1D Deep Convolutional Neural Network (1DDCNN) to significantly reduce noise in distributed optical fiber sensing data.

## Key Features

- **1D-CNN Architecture**: Our architecture leverages a 1D Convolutional Neural Network to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), allowing for more accurate temperature measurements along the fiber.

- **Enhanced Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: The 1DDCNN effectively filters noise from the SpRS signal, resulting in improved SNR and precision.

- **Long-Distance Accuracy**: The 1DDCNN preserves its denoising capabilities even with signal attenuation, enhancing accuracy in long-distance temperature sensing.

- **Reduced Complexity and Cost**: This implementation simplifies the system by eliminating the need for specialized optical fibers or complex pulse coding techniques, thereby lowering overall costs.
